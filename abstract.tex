We describe and analyze a method that blends records from both observed and synthetic 
microdata into public-use tabulations on establishment statistics. The resulting tables use 
synthetic data only in potentially sensitive cells. We describe different algorithms, and present 
preliminary results when applied to the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics and 
Synthetic Longitudinal Business Database, highlighting accuracy and protection afforded by the 
method when compared to existing public-use tabulations (with suppressions).
